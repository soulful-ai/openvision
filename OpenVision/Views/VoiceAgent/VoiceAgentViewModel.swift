// OpenVision - VoiceAgentViewModel.swift
// MVVM: all voice-session orchestration for the main screen lives here — session lifecycle,
// command routing, live video, face intents, photo capture, TTS streaming, and history.
// VoiceAgentView renders this state and forwards user interactions; it holds no logic.
//
// The services are app-wide singletons; this ViewModel is their single orchestrator. Service
// callbacks capture self weakly — the services outlive any owner, so strong captures would pin
// the ViewModel forever.
