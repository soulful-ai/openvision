// OpenVision - NativeTool.swift
// On-device productivity tools the AI calls via function-calling.
//
// Each tool is a small struct backed by a stable Apple framework (UserNotifications, EventKit,
// CoreLocation, UIPasteboard) — deterministic and reliable, no vision/hallucination surface. The
// model decides WHEN to call one; the tool does the work and returns a short spoken result.
//
// Backends that support function-calling (OpenAI, Gemini, Apple Intelligence) expose these; the
// tiny local VLMs don't do reliable tool-calling, so they simply don't advertise them.
